        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>I'm a junior student pursuing a B.A in computer science at UC Berkeley.</p>
        <p>
          I come from China. China is cool. The United States is cool. Everything is cool. But what's especially cool is
          <a href="/noodles.html">noodles</a> from my hometown Suzhou. Ramen is good enough for me though.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love to play the piano in my leisure time and I play nearly nothing other than classical music.
          I also love listening to classical piano music because symphonies alike are still lullabies for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like Japanese culture. The few <a href="omamori.html">omamori</a> I owned brought me what they promised. I also love how they treat life
          as if it doesn't really matter. That's both depressing and inspiring. I wish I can live like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I prefer tea to coffee. After trail and failure for almost 8 years, I have convinced myself that coffee is just not my thing.
          The fact that it contains bitterness is undefeatable - not even with a lot of milk and sugar and honey and chocolate and tea.
          As a result I now drink coffee only when I need some human battery, and I only drink espresso because
          <span style="color: #ff7b00" title="A single acute pain is better than chronical and smooth pain.">长痛不如短痛</span> (<- hover to see translation).
        </p>
        <p>
          I also play video games. I entered Monster Hunter last year and I love it very much. Second to that is Overwatch, which is a <i>dead game</i>.
          Apart from these two, most of the games I play happens with another friend, and the game is just a means to fortify bond between me and my friends.
          StarCraft 2, Overcooked 2, Civilization 5 & 6.
        </p>
        <p>
          I explore myself in unexpected ways. I have been trying to restrain my drinking of water, which became kind of beneficial when I was travelling in Egypt - 
          although it is very hot and dry, since I drink less than others, I bring less water.
          I also tried not to eat for days: it was not successful and I could not resist my hunger during the 36th hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use Arch Linux!
